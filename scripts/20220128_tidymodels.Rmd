# Tidymodels Binary Outcome | Class Imbalance

Here we use the tidymodels framework and deal with class imbalance (little no of events regarding mortality). I loaded the mice imputed data. 

## Death~Age

Is there a relationship between the patient’s age and death prob? 

```{r eda-age}
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  group_by(V_age = 10 * (V_age %/% 10)) %>%
  summarise(
    died = mean(as.numeric(V_o_mortality))-1  # since mortality is encoded as factor w levels 1/2
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(died, names_to = "outcome", values_to = "percent") %>%
  ggplot(aes(V_age, percent)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "% of Patients died", color = NULL)
```

## Death ~ Age + Categorical Vars

Is there a relationship between the patient’s age and death prob and **ST-Depression**? 

```{r eda-1cat-vars}
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  group_by(V_age = 10 * (V_age %/% 10)) %>%
  summarise(
    died = mean(as.numeric(V_o_mortality))-1,  # since mortality is encoded as factor w levels 1/2
    st_depression = mean(as.numeric(V_ekg_st_senkung))-1
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(died:st_depression, names_to = "outcome", values_to = "percent") %>%
  ggplot(aes(V_age, percent, color= outcome)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "% of Patients died", color = NULL)
```

```{r eda-death-all-binary-vars, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
index <- c()
for (i in seq_along(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort)) {
  check <- (length(
    unique(as.numeric(unlist(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort[i])))
    ) <8
    )  #‘<’ not meaningful for factors; 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
  index <- append(index,check)
}
categorical_features <- colnames(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort)[index]
# convert to factor
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort[categorical_features] <- lapply(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort[categorical_features], factor)

index <- c()
for (i in seq_along(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort)) {
  check <- (length(
    unique(as.numeric(unlist(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort[i])))
    ) <=2
    )  #‘<’ not meaningful for factors; 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
  index <- append(index,check)
}
binary_features <- colnames(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort)[index]

library(rlang)
for (i in (binary_features)) {
  if (i != "V_o_mortality") {
    impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
    group_by(V_age = 10 * (V_age %/% 10)) %>%
    summarise(
      died = mean(as.numeric(V_o_mortality))-1,  # since mortality is encoded as factor w levels 1/2
      categorical_var = mean(as.numeric(.data[[i]]))-1  # access variable
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(died:categorical_var, names_to = "outcome", values_to = "percent") %>%
    ggplot(aes(V_age, percent, color= outcome)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    labs(x = "Age", y = "% of Patients died") +
      scale_color_discrete(name = NULL, labels = c({i}, "Died")) +
       theme_minimal() -> age_catplot
    print(age_catplot)
  }
}
```


Are people more likely to die who have a *Pacemaker*?

```{r eda-dying-with-PM}
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  count(V_ekg_schrittmacher, V_o_mortality) %>%
  # group by variable
  group_by(V_ekg_schrittmacher) %>%
  mutate(percent = scales::percent(n / sum(n))) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("Pacemaker", "Died", "Number of people", "% of people"),
    align = "llrr"
  )
```

We can use a similar approach to see how different the rates of death are on different onsets of symptoms:

```{r eda-dying-with-symptom-onset}
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  mutate(V_symptombeginn = fct_lump(V_symptombeginn, prop = 0.25)) %>%  # everything with <25% goes to other category
  count(V_symptombeginn, V_o_mortality) %>%
  group_by(V_symptombeginn) %>%
  mutate(percent = scales::percent(n / sum(n))) %>%  # label percentages 
  kable(
    col.names = c("Symptombeginn(h)", "Died", "Number of people", "% of people"),
    align = "llrr"
  )

impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  #mutate(V_symptombeginn = fct_lump(V_symptombeginn, prop = 0.25)) %>%  # everything with <25% goes to other category
  count(V_symptombeginn, V_o_mortality) %>%
  group_by(V_symptombeginn) %>%
  mutate(percent = scales::percent(n / sum(n))) %>%  # label percentages 
  kable(
    col.names = c("Symptombeginn(h)", "Died", "Number of people", "% of people"),
    align = "llrr"
  )
```

It seems that people were more likely to die if symptom onset has been earlier. We can plot this: 

Let’s make one last exploratory plot and look at seasons. How much difference is there in survival across the four seasons?

```{r eda-PLOT-dying-with-symptom-onset}
impdat.ml.mean.with_mort %>%
  #filter(cat != "Unknown") %>%  # we just wanna have our 4 seasons
  count(V_symptombeginn, V_o_mortality) %>%
  group_by(V_symptombeginn) %>%
  mutate(
    percent = n / sum(n),
    died = case_when(                          # !!!!!
      V_o_mortality == "1" ~ "Died",
      V_o_mortality == "0" ~ "Did not die"  # died was logical before
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(V_symptombeginn, percent, fill = V_symptombeginn)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8, position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  facet_wrap(~died, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Symptom Onset", y = "% of Patients")
```

# Build a model 

We can start by splitting our data into training and testing sets.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(123)
members_split <- initial_split(impdat.ml.mean.with_mort, strata = V_o_mortality)
members_train <- training(members_split)
members_test <- testing(members_split)
```

We are going to use resampling to evaluate model performance, so let’s get those resampled sets ready.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
members_folds <- vfold_cv(members_train, strata = V_o_mortality)  # also resampling stratified
```

Next we build a recipe for data preprocessing.

- First, we must tell the recipe() what our model is going to be (using a formula here) and what our training data is.
- Next, we remove the .id variable.
- Next, we use step_other() to collapse categorical levels for peak and citizenship. Before this step, there were hundreds of values in each variable.
- After this, we can create indicator variables for the non-numeric, categorical values, except for the outcome died which we need to keep as a factor.
- Finally, there are many more people who did not die than who died so we will use step_smote() to balance the classes.

```{r recipe}
library(themis)  # additional for smote!!!

members_rec <- recipe(V_o_mortality ~ ., data = members_train) %>%
  #step_rm(.id) %>%
  update_role(.id, new_role="ID") %>% 
  # step_other(V_h_lvdys_grad) %>%  # potentially pool infrequently occurring values into an "other" category.
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), -V_o_mortality) %>%  # create dummy vars for all factor vars
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%  # ML models train better when the data is centered & scaled
  step_zv(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%  # Get rid of features that have zero variance
  themis::step_smote(died)
```

```{r}
summary(members_rec)
```

# Software

This analysis was carried out using the statistical software `r base::version$version.string`.

Apart from R's base functionality, the following packages were used: <br/>

```{r software, echo=FALSE}
# or faster with function...
installed.packages()[names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs), "Version"]
