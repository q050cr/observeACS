# observeACS

Unfortunately, many EDs are confronted with a large number of patients with suspected ACS that can neither be classified as rule-out nor 
rule-in and require more observation time for additional troponin testing and diagnostic workup. This observe zone comprises 25-40% of 
suspected ACS patients and is essentially characterized by stable elevation of hs-cTn indicating underlying structural heart disease, 
CAD, or both, mirrors other relevant comorbidities  and thus reflects increased individual risk. While 30-daysÂ´mortality is not very different 
from patients in the rule-out category, mortality at 12 months is at least as high as mortality in the rule-in category6. Other biomarkers 
including Copeptin, NT-pro BNP and D-Dimers have been found to provide additional and independent prognostic (all biomarkers) and diagnostic 
information (NT-pro BNP and D-dimers) that might help to identify the relevant pathomechanism leading to index ED admission and individualize
risk assessment.
